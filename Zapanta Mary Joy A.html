    <u><h1>"life is strange"</h1></p></u>
  
    <p>I'm walking in a strange life,<br />
    Living in a place that is full of <span style="color:brown">beasts</span>,<br />
    Since I was a child 'til now stand still,<br />
    In the middle of an <i>unknown road</i>,<br />
    Every stop had a <strong>lesson to learn</strong>.<br /></p>
    
    <p>Surroundings has different perspectives, <br />
    Every move eyes centered only on me, <br />
    Mistakes will be honored to lead to disrespect, <br />
   And every one a cheer me up as a mess,<br />
   Some of them comforted me as well as <i><span style="color:orange">tied</span> me silently</i>.<br /></p>

   <p>Beautiful <span style="color:red">flowers</span> will be cared for and praised,<br />
   Whereas the deadly will be in the wild forest,<br />
   Seeing us precisely in order where we belong,<br />
   I heed the difference <i>between heaven and earth</i>,<br />
   They threaten people for their <kbd>power and level</kbd>.<br /></p>
